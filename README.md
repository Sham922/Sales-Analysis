This Power BI project delivers two interactive dashboards: one focused on Sales Analysis and the other on Product Performance. These dashboards provide a 360-degree view of monthly sales performance against budget, top-performing products, customer insights, and category-based trends. Ideal for stakeholders to make data-driven business decisions in a retail or e-commerce environment.
